# Data Analysis Project 
This is a simple data analysis project tracked with Git. 
Added data_preprocessing.py script for cleaning 

# Assignment 1: Git Foundations & Personal Project Management

This project demonstrates the use of **Git fundamentals** for managing a personal project. It focuses on repository setup, version control, branching, and pushing to a remote repository.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To master fundamental Git commands and understand the importance of versioning for a single-developer project.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Scenario
A personal data analysis project was created to practice Git basics. The repository demonstrates initialization, creating and using `.gitignore`, branching, merging, and pushing changes to GitHub.

---

## ðŸ›  Required Tools
- Git  
- GitHub account  
- Code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime, PyCharm)  
- Python (or any other language)  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

expert-spork/ â”‚-- data_preprocessing.py   # Example Python script â”‚-- .gitignore              # Ignore rules â”‚-- README.md               # Documentation

---

## ðŸš€ Steps to Reproduce

### 1. Initialize Repository
```bash
git init
git branch -M main

2. Create a .gitignore

Add rules to ignore temporary files, virtual environment folders (.venv/), and unnecessary data files.

Example:

.venv/
__pycache__/
*.csv
*.log

3. Add Files and Commit

git add .
git commit -m "feat: Initial project setup and .gitignore"

4. Create and Work on a Feature Branch

git checkout -b develop

Make edits (e.g., add data_preprocessing.py), then commit:

git add data_preprocessing.py
git commit -m "feat: Add script for data cleaning"

5. Merge Changes Back to Main

git checkout main
git merge develop

6. Push Repository to GitHub

git remote add origin https://github.com/ayush20025/expert-spork.git
git push -u origin main


---

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/ayush20025/expert-spork.git

Commit History:

feat: Initial project setup and .gitignore

feat: Add script for data cleaning


Branching: At least one feature branch (develop) merged into main.
